content = "Built a proxy metric system for streamer performance evaluation using session-level attribution data, replacing revenue-based metrics to better capture streamers' organic growth ability. Assessed the real value of sharing behavior on user retention through counterfactual modeling with logistic regression across user segments. Validated the rationality of attribution time-window thresholds using fixed-effects panel models, providing evidence-based input for cross-team policy decisions."
